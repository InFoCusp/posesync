## ðŸ“– Overview

We present a tool to synchronize videos of people performing similar actions. This can be useful for applications like - 
* Comparing game play of two players
* Side by side view of dance moves
* Comparison of any moves that require side by side video

This open source tool allows you to compare any two videos by bringing them in sync using the state of the art models at its backend for performing pose estimation and matching the poses.

It consists of three stages:
* Cropping (Using YOLO v5 / tracker)
* Pose Detection (Movenet)
* Video Matching (Dynamic Time Warping)
    
1. **Cropping**

    First, video is cropped frame by frame with help of object detection which is supported by two methods, YOLO and Tracker by OpenCV.

2. **Pose Detection** 

    Then, MoveNet Pose Detection is applied on cropped video which returns the keypoints.

3. **Video Matching**

   Finally, DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) processes the sequences of pose detected from two videos.
